ShowIKRSS uses RSS to display Imagekind Galleries.

== Description ==

ShowIKRSS uses RSS to display Imagekind Galleries. Insert &quot;[rsspics:IMGSIZE,SASID,TRKCODE,URL]&quot; into a post or page.  Replace &quot;IMGSIZE&quot; with the size image you want to show... 100, 150, 200, 350, 450, or 650.  Replace &quot;SASID&quot; with your ShareASale ID number.  Replace &quot;TRKCODE&quot; with a Tracking code. Replace &quot;URL&quot; with the URL of the RSS feed starting with &quot;http://&quot;.

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `showikrss.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set your options from the settings menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I want to show a different image size in a post?

    Detail might show up better in a larger size or some images may show up well at a smaller size.

= Why would you use a different SASID in a post?

    You could have a team blog or guest blogger and each blogger could use their own ID.

= Why should I use a unique tracking ID?

    It’ll help you know where sales are coming from.
